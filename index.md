## Space Truckers API

You've got a ship, a destination, and a whole galaxy to explore. Now you just need to code up the frontend for it...

### What is Space Truckers API

Space Truckers API is an MMOAPI, in extremely early alpha. The endpoints are available at <https://spacetruckers.teamrocket.space/> and use HATEOAS to help guide you around, use sensible HTTP methods such as GET, POST and PUT and see what happens.

### How do I play

A tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a good start. Ideally though, you'll write your own project to interact with the game, offering you an excellent and rewarding space to learn a new language or flex your existing skills.
